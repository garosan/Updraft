To maintain a clean terminal, especially when it becomes cluttered, you can type the command "clear" and press Enter. Alternatively, use the shortcut `command + k` on a Mac or `control + k` on Linux or Windows.

It's important to understand the difference between the **`trash can`** and the **`x`** icons in your VS code terminal: clicking the **`x`** icon it will _hide/show the terminal_, keeping all previous content visible when reopened. Clicking on the **`trash can`** icon instead, _terminates the current terminal session_. When you reopen it, youâ€™ll see a fresh, empty session.
